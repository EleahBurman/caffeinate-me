## üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Getting Started
"Caffeinate-Me" was inspired by my love of coffee.  I love going to family-owned cafes around the United States.  I drink 8 cups of coffee a day. There are so many coffee-lovers out there that want to connect over their love of coffee.

Explore the world of cafes with this open-source MEAN stack application. You can review your favorite cafes, add new reviews, and connect with coffee enthusiasts effortlessly.  Integrated with Google OAuth for easy access, this platform empowers you to seamlessly add new cafe reviews, edit your existing reviews, sort all the reviews as you like, and even connect with fellow coffee enthusiasts by adding them as friends. Additionally, you have the creative freedom to enhance your profile by adding gifs and personalizing the color scheme, making it uniquely yours. You will no longer have to scroll through your notes app to remember the cafe you saw five months ago.  Caffeinate yourself as you add more cafes to "Caffeinate-Me!"
